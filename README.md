# UE Project Launcher

Small app to launch any UProject file with easy to set launch flags

How to use:
1. Grab a copy from the releases section (coming soon)
2. Run UELauncher.exe

The program creates a ``defaultconfig.ini`` file in ``%APPDATA%\UEProjectLauncher`` to store the last used uproject file path and program settings

Made using _Dear PyGui_
